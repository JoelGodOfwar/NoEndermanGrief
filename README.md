# NoEndermanGrief

This is a very simple plugin that allows a server admin, to turn off Endermen being able to pickup or set down blocks.
This plugin also allows a server admin, to turn off Skeleton Horse spawns, Creeper griefing, and Wandering trader spawns.

So if you don't like Endermen griefing your builds, Hate when Creepers 
make holes in your yard/build, Don't like the Skeleton Horse traps, and 
are annoyed by Wandering Traders, then this plugin is for you.
